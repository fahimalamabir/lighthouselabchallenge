Data Analysis is one of the most valuable skills you can learn to upskill your career and standout in a competitive job market.  The wide applicability of data skills is why they've become very valuable. But developing a new skill can be difficult. You've probably already worked with data in some shape or form, reviewing a spreadsheet of statistics or managing customer data. But to truly learn how to master data, you need to dive right in and immerse yourself in it. You need to commit to practicing every day.  That's why Lighthouse Labs created the 21-Day Data Challenge.
