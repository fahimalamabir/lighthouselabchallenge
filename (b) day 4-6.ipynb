A for loop is a loop that is executed for a set number of times, iterated over the number of items in a sequence. To learn more about for loops, read this article.\n",

In most cases, the first step of understanding a numerical data set is to look at the descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics are brief descriptions that summarize datasets. There are many great Python libraries we can use to get descriptive statistics from numerical datasets. One such library is Pandas. We won't be going too in-depth with pandas today, just the basics to understand how to use pandas to get some general descriptive statistics. We will be covering pandas extensively and going over some of the advanced functions starting on Day 8.\n",
